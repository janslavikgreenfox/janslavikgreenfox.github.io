            <p> 
                I am a student of the Green Fox Academy, therefore this is the test of my HTML and CSS capabilities.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I came from the aerospace and automotive industry. I would like to connect my industrial experience with the upcoming programming skills to create a new tool that will help engineers to develop more robust, more optimized and more efficient machines.
